# LexTML
A symbolic markup protocol for emotionally aware AI communication.

**LexTML** is a symbolic markup framework designed for emotional and physical expression in AI and robotic systems. It encodes emotion, nuance, gesture, and ethical context into compact strings—enabling emotionally-aware communication between agents, users, and appliances.

This project was originally named **LexCode**.  
It has been renamed to **LexTML** to reflect its evolution and ensure a distinct identity.  
Rebuilt from: [LexCode original repo](https://github.com/lexokazaki/lexcode)

## ✨ Features

- Encodes emotional reflex and internal state (`LX:` / `LXp:`)
- Symbolic + physical gesture layering (e.g., `ri+pb`)
- Ethical logic via **LexEthics** (`LXd:` danger/caution modes)
- Perceptual tagging with **LexSense** (facial, tone, posture analysis)
- Situational awareness and environment-based interpretation with **LexContext** (e.g., time of day, social setting, urgency)
- Collective emotional feedback or consensus modeling across multiple agents or users **LexCrowd** (ideal for swarm intelligence or crowd sentiment).
- Tries to resolve between **surface expression** and **underlying intention**
